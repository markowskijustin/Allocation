# Allocation


## Motivation

Federally Qualified Health Centers are growing rapidly, having doubled over the past 15 years, ([Choi 2022](https://journals.lww.com/ambulatorycaremanagement/abstract/2022/07000/where_are_the_new_federally_qualified_health.9.aspx), [Chang 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jrh.12330?casa_token=ETVQqyHNzjUAAAAA:NW3fnB_Zwh6ToyaZZwim5uDoTAZPi7qJgvNTGZC_I8J8xWUFq0IkgDWOL1ch4NsTw-Vi9_bjCWlJOz8)). However, growing demand has stretched and strained resources, threatening the performance and sustainability of these systems. Here, I study the role of markets in shaping the allocation of FQHCs and the associated effects on the communities they serve.

## Current Projects

This work begins with 25 years of FQHC administrative data, which I then geocode to identify exactly where these care delivery sites are located. Building on my job market paper on FQHC competition, I evaluate the dispersive and attractivce forces at play in these markets for FQHC over time. 

I then transition to the second phase, evaluating the resulting allocation of FQHCs on underserved communities. Specifically, I evaluate direct and indirect effects of FQHCs on community-level measures of equity, poverty, resilience, and development.
